## Question 1: Engel Curve (Microeconomics)

**Question:**
In a two-goods consumption framework, the Engel curve shows the relationship between:

**Options:**
A) income and quantity demanded of one of the goods
B) price of one good and quantity demanded of the other good
C) relative price of the goods and ratio of their quantities demanded
D) income and the ratio of quantities demanded of the two goods

**✅ Correct Answer:**
Option A

**📘 Detailed Solution:**

**Step 1: Identify the Concept**
This question is based on the concept of the Engel Curve from consumer theory in Microeconomics.

**Step 2: What is an Engel Curve?**
An Engel Curve represents the relationship between:
* Consumer’s income (Y)
* and quantity demanded of a particular good (Qx)

It shows how the demand for a good changes when income changes, keeping prices constant.

Mathematically: $Q_x = f(Y)$

**Step 3: Analyze the Options**
Let’s examine each option:
* **Option A:** “income and quantity demanded of one of the goods” → This exactly matches the definition of Engel Curve. ✅
* **Option B:** Talks about price and quantity – that is related to demand curve, not Engel curve. ❌
* **Option C:** Talks about relative prices – that relates to price consumption curve, not Engel curve. ❌
* **Option D:** Ratio of quantities – this is not what Engel curve represents. ❌

**Step 4: Final Understanding**
Engel Curve always connects:
👉 Income → Quantity demanded of a single good

Therefore, the correct conceptual match is Option A.

**🧩 Key Takeaways:**
* Engel Curve studies the effect of income changes on demand.
* Prices are held constant in Engel curve analysis.
* It helps classify goods into: Normal goods, Inferior goods, Luxury goods.
